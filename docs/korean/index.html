<ul>
<li><strong>On Pronunciation</strong>:</li>
<li><strong>Are you actually thinking?</strong>: language nerds love to opine about their gargantuan index card stack or about the volumes of media they&rsquo;ve consumed, but an important matter often ignored (yet more identifiably linked to fluency) is whether you&rsquo;re able to think in the language, and ultimately this should be the goal of true fluency. After building up a basic repertoire of grammar and vocabulary, the language should become part and parcel of your day-to-day. You should try to think in it, you should try to subconsciously translate english phrases you see to that language, you should try (and inevitably stumble and fail) to create new sentences and phrases using the words and grammar you know. If you mutter about this or that, do so in the language. Note this can be done even if you have no conversation partners and are not immersed in an environment apt for practicing the language.</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s a misconception that children learn languages easily by mere virtue of just &ldquo;consuming a lot of media&rdquo;. Yes, consuming media helps. But, children also have a lot of social motivation to try very hard to <em>participate in</em> and <em>produce</em> conversation, whether that be aloud or even in thought. To learn as fluidly as they do requires a similar courage (read: willingness to fail) and enthusiasm.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Translating to English will make less sense the better you get</strong>: poorly designed language courses in American education often set the goal of developing an unwieldy rube goldberg engine for understanding and using the language <em>through English</em>. This is evidenced by the inordinate focus on vocabulary memorization, which are always first translated into (and so necessarily <em>mediated via</em>) English and the hilariously complicated mnemonic devices and songs to learn simple concepts in the target language. So, the language is treated as mere mental drudgery, no different than some arcane trivia you need to regurgitate for a chemistry test. I&rsquo;d even argue this makes sense for the most popular languages learned by Americans, e.g. Spanish, French, Italian, as they&rsquo;re morphologically quite similar to English, but likely not so for most distant languages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Children who learn the language natively obviously don&rsquo;t learn their languages this way, and instead learn via proper immersion and a willingness to think in that language as per the above point. And so, I feel a language like Korean should actually just be a different way of thinking and the better you get at it, the less sense it will make to translate it into English. In fact, this is a good sign as it means you have internalized the vibes of that language in their own context, rather than through English.</p>
<p>So, English to Korean flashcards will be helpful at the beginning, but the ideal is to eventually learn things as a budding Korean does: exclusively in Korean and via trial and error and proper participation. Of course, one never truly forgets about English because Korean has many loan words and phrases, but even these things should be separately internalized (and pronounced) as Koreans do natively, and not as shared words of different languages. Indeed, one will find some English words don&rsquo;t have quite the same contextual usage in English as they do as loan words in Korean.</p>
<p>For this reason, I would also discourage using question-and-answer formats where there is a reliance on translation to English (e.g., Duolingo&rsquo;s multiple choice questions to translate Korean into English), as these just further the agenda of developing a &ldquo;English translation engine&rdquo; in your mind, which should not be the goal.</p>
