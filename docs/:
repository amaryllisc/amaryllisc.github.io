## 단어집 (vocabulary)
Although I am keen on memorizing stuff and not really intimidated by it, my impression is it's best to learn vocabulary slowly and in conjunction with grammar. Korean tends to rely heavily on idioms and using words (particularly verbs and adverbs) in ways which do not directly correspond to the English usage. Thus, mass-memorizing vocabulary may only prove foolhardy, and will result in an awkward Korean (which Koreans will mostly understand and forgive) but which is obviously foreign. The goal for me is to, to the best of my ability, speak and use as the natives do, and hide the fact that I'm a foreigner.

I think the goal should be to first have a small vocabulary arsenal, but to be able to employ such an arsenal flawlessly in grammar and sentences. Only then do you build up and learn more words, thus emulating how a native child learns the language.

Popular apps/flash card tools used by language learners for vocab include:
* [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
* [memrise](https://www.memrise.com/en-us/)

## 목표 (suggested benchmarks/goals, in increasing order of difficulty)

* being able to read a simple book.
* [Test of Proficiency in Korean (TOPIK)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_of_Proficiency_in_Korean) used to measure 한글 proficiency for foreigners in Korea.


## misc. thoughts/contrarian wisdom on learning languages
* **On Pronunciation**: to achieve proper pronunciation, one really needs to "prepare phonologically" for it, which involves changing their mindset from English pronunciation. Sometimes, people are afraid to do this for appearing too tryhard or for fear of messing up. We all know the apathetic American jockbro in Spanish class who almost deliberately pronounced every word in a non-Spanish accent. Sometimes, they do this out of anxiety because it actually sounds more natural to them, and they don't want to look like an idiot who speaks in a "foreign" accent. Americans have this narcissism because foreigners come to America trying to emulate an American accent and phonology. But, it's complete folly: to any native Spanish speaker, you would sound like an idiot speaking in that accent.

    One trick some say is that you should think of the most stereotypical accent/pronunciation for that language and speak in that accent when using the language. While you may sound "tryhard" to Americans, to natives of that language you will sound so much more natural and less weird. This is, of course, predicated on having a familiarity of what the stereotypical sounds in that language are.

* **Are you actually thinking?**: language nerds love to opine about their gargantuan index card stack or about the volumes of media they've consumed, but an important matter often ignored (yet more identifiably linked to fluency) is whether you're able to think in the language, and ultimately this should be the goal of true fluency. After building up a basic repertoire of grammar and vocabulary, the language should become part and parcel of your day-to-day. You should try to think in it, you should try to subconsciously translate english phrases you see to that language, you should try (and inevitably stumble and fail) to create new sentences and phrases using the words and grammar you know. If you mutter about this or that, do so in the language. Note this can be done even if you have no conversation partners and are not immersed in an environment apt for practicing the language.

    There's a misconception that children learn languages easily by mere virtue of just "consuming a lot of media". Yes, consuming media helps. But, children also have a lot of social motivation to try very hard to _participate in_ and _produce_ conversation, whether that be aloud or even in thought. To learn as fluidly as they do requires a similar courage (read: willingness to fail) and enthusiasm.
* **Translating to English will make less sense the better you get**: poorly designed language courses in American education often set the goal of developing an unwieldy rube goldberg engine for understanding and using the language _through English_. This is evidenced by the inordinate focus on vocabulary memorization, which are always first translated into (and so necessarily _mediated via_) English and the hilariously complicated mnemonic devices and songs to learn simple concepts in the target language. So, the language is treated as mere mental drudgery, no different than some arcane trivia you need to regurgitate for a history test. I'd even argue this makes sense for the most popular languages learned by Americans, e.g. Spanish, French, Italian, as they're morphologically quite similar to English (and so can be used near fluently in such a plug-and-play manner), but likely not so for more distant languages.

    Children who learn the language natively obviously don't learn this way, and instead learn via proper immersion and a willingness to think in that language as per the above point. And so, I feel a language like Korean should actually just be a different way of thinking and the better you get at it, the less sense it will make to translate it into English. In fact, this is a good sign as it means you have internalized the vibes of that language in their own and original context, rather than through American sensibilities.

    So, English to Korean flashcards will be helpful at the beginning, but the ideal is to eventually learn things as a budding Korean does: exclusively in Korean and via trial and error and proper participation. Of course, one never truly forgets about English because Korean has many loan words and phrases, but even these things should be separately internalized (and pronounced) as Koreans do natively, and not as shared words of different languages. Indeed, one will find some English words don't have quite the same contextual usage in English as they do as loan words in Korean.

    For this reason, I would also discourage using question-and-answer formats where there is a reliance on translation to English (e.g., Duolingo's multiple choice questions to translate Korean into English), as these just further the agenda of developing an "English translation engine" in your mind, rather than internalizing the language. Cognitively, for an English-thinking mind, they're also easier to complete and so give a false impression that you're comfortable in the language, when you're merely comfortable translating it to English.

    For the same reason, I would also avoid watching things with English subtitles as your mind very quickly "turns off" the other language and pretty much hears things in English (e.g., white people who've watched thousands of hours of anime but don't even know the most basic words in Japanese).
