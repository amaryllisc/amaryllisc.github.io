<p>I present two full-body workouts that can be alternated on a 2-day/week schedule. Each workout is hyperlinked to a timestamped video showing the correct form.</p>
<p>The main focus of these workouts is on compound movements (e.g., squats, bench press, shoulder press, deadlifts, pullups) which work multiple muscles simultaneously and promote stabilizers. The exact ordering of exercises in each workout is not super important, but I would generally try to start with the big compound exercises (e.g., starting with squats in A or deadlifts in B) and then finish with the &ldquo;smaller&rdquo; isolation exercises (e.g., curls). If it makes more sense to move around or switch some exerices because of equipment availability or time constraints, then feel free to do so.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also designed this workout to only require dumbbells, a bench, and some cable machines, i.e. no barbell or power rack required. If a cable machine is unavailable, even still I provide substitutions which can be done with free weights.</p>
<p>Starting out, I would first sit down and try to read or watch a video about every exercise here. For each exercise, you should know what muscles are involved and should be engaged as you are doing the exercise. As you are doing said exercise, over time you should be able to notice these muscles &ldquo;activated&rdquo; or engaged in said exercise, and this can be a rough check for whether you are doing it properly or not.
For each exercise, I would learn the form first and get it down pat using the lightest weight or even no weight. Then, I would try to find what weight I can do it for 3 sets of 6-12 reps for.</p>
<p>Feel free to experiment and substitute or modify the exercises as you see fit, and however best makes sense for your goals, time constraints, and available equipment.</p>

<h2 id="faq-general-advice-and-things-ive-learned-over-the-years">FAQ, general advice, and things I&rsquo;ve learned over the years</h2>
<ul>
<li><em>How many reps should I do?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The exact number of reps for each set is not really important and, as you can see above, for most exercises I keep it in the 8-12 range. The most important thing is that the weight and rep count feels strenuous enough that each set is near your limit, i.e. you can do the set but only have 1-2 reps left in the tank. Starting out, you may feel that the third set is much harder than the first set for the same weight and rep count. This is not uncommon, and thus many people do sets in decreasing rep-counts like 12, 10, 8 reps with the same weight. Find what makes sense for you and the weights you have available to you.</p>
<p>On the other extreme, you also shouldn&rsquo;t be failing at the last rep of every set. This means your sets are too hard and you will likely be too fatigued to do that set successfully the next time. This is also dangerous in the long-term as it promotes breaking form. The sweet spot in difficulty is, again, having 1-2 reps left in the tank.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How long should I rest?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>2-3 minute rest times between sets are common. Resting longer is <em>not</em> a bad thing; in fact, it is very common for people to not rest long enough which contributes to quick burnout on later sets. If you are resting too little or feel like you don&rsquo;t need any rest at all between sets, then you&rsquo;re not lifting heavy enough to meaningfully build muscle. If you finished a set, barely being able to complete the last rep or even failing to do the last rep, then you should rest longer than usual. In fact, if this is occurring often, you should lower the weight (see above discussion about what weight/rep to choose). Heavy compound lifts (e.g., deadlifts or squats) done for small number of reps (6-8) naturally also require longer rest times as these are going to be the most strenuous lifts for your body.</p>
<p>I just use a timer to record my rest times, but most people just play by the feel of their bodies to know if they are rested enough to do another set.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Can I superset all my exercises?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Supersetting is generally recommended for complementary exercises which work different muscles (e.g., push exercises with pull exercises, or upper body with lower body). It is good for building endurance and saving time, but will definitely fatigue your lifts even if using complementary exercises. Just keep this in mind as you track your progress.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>How do I improve and build muscle/strength?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>First, you should try to at least roughly remember or recall how many reps you do for each exercise and what weight you used for each set. I just write these down for every workout. Then, your goal is <em>progressive overload</em>, or to improve either the weights or reps from each week to week. Sometimes, this will be very miniscule like moving from 10 lb at 12,10,8 reps to 10 lb at 12,10,9 reps but even that still counts. Be wary that if you increase the weight, you will often have to lower the rep counts, e.g. it might make more sense to jump from 3x12 at 10 lb to 3x6-8 at 15 lb since 3x12 at 15 lb might be too dramatic of a difference to acclimate to in one week.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there will be weeks where you find you can&rsquo;t improve from the week before, or that you&rsquo;ve even gone down in reps/weight from the week before (can occur from stress, lack of sleep, improper diet). <em>This is normal</em> and you shouldn&rsquo;t worry. What&rsquo;s more important is the long-term progress and how you are improving on a scale of months.</p>
<p>Also, if you want to seriously build muscle, you should be getting at least 0.8 g of protein per lb of body mass (i.e., 80-90 g for someone who is 100-110 lb). I&rsquo;ll write a separate guide on diet.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What if I can&rsquo;t do 5 pullups or a small number of reps of an exercise at the lowest weight?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Even if your one-set max on pull-ups is 5-6, you shouldn&rsquo;t be doing 3x(5-6) pullups in your workout as per the above advice on not making each set too hard. If doing 3x6 of pullups is way too hard for you, I would start by doing 3x8-12 of negatives and/or dead-hangs (easier than pullups but will quickly get you to doing 5 solid pullups consistently), or assisted pullups, or lat pull downs instead. Only once you are able to do 8-10 pullups in one go would i start incorporating them into the workout at 3x(5-6).</p>
<p>You can also adjust the pullup position to make it easier. Chin-ups (where your palms are turned inside facing you) are easiest, then the neutral grip (palms facing each other), then the palms facing outward grip in order of difficulty. So, if you can only do 8-10 chin-ups, start with chin-ups.</p>
<p>You can also incorporate more sets of curls and rows (e.g., doing 3 sets of cable rows and then doing 3 sets of dumbbell rows) which will also contribute to your pullup strength as you get better at them.</p>
<p>Similarly, if on another exercise you find you can&rsquo;t even do it 6-8 solid reps with the lowest dumbbell weight, then you will need to find a way to do the exercise in an alternative easier way where you can build strength on a 3x6-12 basis. How to do this will depend on the exercise and require research (feel free to ask me).</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Can I run while lifting weights?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>You can do light running on the same day before a lift, but doing a strenuous run before you lift will most likely severely fatigue your lifts. If I&rsquo;m going to run on the same day as lifting, I like to run afterwards. Note that lifting first will inevitably weaken your run, but after a while as my body gets used to lifting, I barely notice this effect while running.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>What is the best way to get abs?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a common misconception that abs exceptionally require very high volume, e.g. hundreds of crunches per workout, to build. This is false. Abs should be trained like any other muscle, at roughly 3x8-12 ranges once/twice a week. Like every muscle, the exercise should be adjusted based on difficulty. If you can pump out a hundred crunches without breaking a sweat, then doing 3x8-12 of ordinary crunches makes no sense and you should be doing weighted crunches or some other exercise that gives more resistance.</p>
<p>Also, getting visible abs is mostly a matter of body fat percentage and thus depends on caloric deficits to lose body fat. Ab exercises are mostly about building core strength and not about making abs &ldquo;more visible&rdquo;.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Tips for form and safety?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>For mastering form of the big compound lifts, I&rsquo;d carefully read the <a href="https://stronglifts.com/5x5/#Exercises">Stronglifts guide</a> on each exercise. For compound lifts at low reps, it&rsquo;s generally recommended to stretch a lot and do several sets of warmup gradually building up to your target weight at the first set.</p>
<p>In general, for all exercises, you should grip the dumbbell as tight as possible to minimize the work your wrists have to do while performing the exercise. For press exercises (i.e., bench press or shoulder press) you should <em>not</em> bend your wrist and should try to rest the dumbbell on the heel of your wrist, rather than closer to your fingers. See also the <a href="https://stronglifts.com/bench-press/#Wrists">wrist advice on the bench press guide</a> which also applies to dumbbells.</p>
<p>Also, for dumbbell press exercises, try not to do them with your arms laterally to your side as this puts a lot of pressure on your shoulder and rotator cuffs. For example, in the bench press, you should be pressing the dumbbells diagonally and your arms should not be perpendicular to your torso, but instead making a 45-75 degree angle with your sides (see <a href="https://youtu.be/NCSVzCpEtx8?t=177">here</a>). The same applies to the shoulder press: bring your arms a little bit forward (at roughly a 75 degree angle) past your torso when shoulder pressing.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing shoulder pain from press exercises, I would immediately stop and do a thorough double check of my form. I&rsquo;ve also had success incorporating <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoBBo1dtY6I">band pull-aparts</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IndIttUTNMU">face-pulls</a> (the latter can be done with a cable machine or a resistance band) into both my warmups and even between sets of shoulder press and bench press to help my shoulders.</p>
<p>Note that the dumbbell shoulder press can be done seated or standing. With the seated, you can generally press more weight because you don&rsquo;t have to stabilize your back, whereas the standing forces you to stabilize more. The choice is yours. However, when doing standing presses, make sure to clench your butt (which keeps your back neutral) and try not to lean back.</p>
