<article>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always had this image of a successful person on my mind, largely informed by other people&rsquo;s ideas of success. A successful person is healthy. A successful person has a lot of friends, and is worldly, and well-read, and smart, and attractive, and unique. A successful person is competent and wealthy. Sometimes, the exact aspects can be nebulous, but this general image is always on my mind, and infiltrates every facet of my life.</p>
<p>The way I judge success for myself is usually not based on how much I adhere to this image, for it is not really possible to do this since the image is vague to begin with and since the scale is infinite with no real epitome (i.e., you can always be more successful). But, rather, it is based on how much <em>more</em> I adhere to this image than other people, or how much more they adhere to it than me.</p>
<p>When I maladaptively daydream, I am actually always thinking of this success image. Sometimes, I am just maladaptively daydreaming out of loneliness, but even these instances are actually about success in my opinion. Or, at least, all my maladaptive daydreams have evolved into being about success at this point in my life. My earliest instances of MD were mainly about having friends because I didn&rsquo;t have any in real life, especially not at school. For example, in fifth grade, I would MD that the characters from Harry Potter were real people and my friends since I was obsessed with Harry Potter at the time. In seventh grade, I would MD that various characters from various shows and internet content I watched were real people and my friends. I think initially this was purely out of loneliness and my lack of close friendships. However, when I indulged in this same maladaptive daydream later in life (including now), it is more about &ldquo;comparing how many friends I have and the quality of my friendships&rdquo; with other people.</p>
<p>Since a young age, I remember being very jealous when finding out that someone, who I initially pegged to be a loner like me, actually had close friends or a lot of friends. And, a lot of this jealousy arises fromy conceptions about how cool or successful their friends are, which in my mind dictated the quality of said person&rsquo;s friendships. For example, the feelings would intensify if I learned that this person was friends with attractive or smart people. I also remember being very jealous and confused (maybe even angry) when finding out that someone who was &ldquo;good at school&rdquo; or one of the smart kids had a lot of friends. This confused me because I believed I was good at school, and one of the smart kids. Yet, I didn&rsquo;t have any friends. So, I thought that one cannot be attained without sacrificing the other, which was the only hypothesis which proved I am still &ldquo;as successful&rdquo; as other people while minimizing who is successful: i.e., this was a giant self-serving cope.</p>
<p>However, as I saw more people who are indeed smart and indeed have many friends, these two qualities became inextricably linked. So much so that &ldquo;having friends&rdquo; became an idea of success to me, and I would resent it in other people. This was because of a larger phenomenon where I resented success when it was not in me.</p>
<p>So, I daydreamed about success in both of these regards. I daydreamed that I was smart and attractive, because I lacked these things in my actual life. And I daydreamed that I had a lot of successful friends, and was renowned, because this was sorely lacking in my life.</p>
<p>And, it always felt to me like the daydreaming was &ldquo;in response&rdquo; to this imaginary version of the people I am jealous of judging me. I would see these people who I envied, who were smart and attractive and had a lot of friends. And, in my mind, they would be judging me and condescending upon me, just like how I condescended on others who lacked the qualities that I possessed. I really hated the feeling of being judged like this, or the feeling that these other people knew how much of a loser I am. I even grew to hate being perceived by other people at all (or at least feeling that I am).</p>
<p>I think children and teenagers often get this kind of sentiment. They refuse to believe their doddering and bumbling parents understand anything about them. They have to be contrarians and listen to the loudest, most obnoxious and profane music. They refuse to believe that their mates at school can, with harsh and laser-like precision, can quantify their exact place on the social pecking order. The pathological liar is often born in response, concocting the fake girlfriend who goes to a different school, writing the Mary Sue fan fiction where everyone claps to their prowess, going off about &ldquo;sigma males&rdquo; and obscure internet rabbit holes of which only they can cultivate expertise, while others remain plebeians.</p>
<p>My daydreams are a similar kind of &ldquo;response&rdquo; to judgment that a pariah, a loser, a nerd does at this age.And, it&rsquo;s an intensely bitter and pathetically self-comforting kind of response. It is like I am very desperately sending a plea to the outside world (maybe to myself): &ldquo;Oh please, look at me! I am actually cool. I actually have friends! See? I am not such a loser!&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate with some personal examples. Try to read them with some levity though. I&rsquo;m actually kind of laughing instead of feeling like I am about to cry as I write this.</p>
<ol>
<li>In high school, the other smart and successful kids who I perceived as my competition were all friends with each other, and less with me. I mean, they were more than genial to me, but we were always kind of detached and maybe I was just awkward or shy or just said too much weird out-there shit. But, this made me intensely bitter, and the green monster of jealousy lurking in my soul could only be abated by MD&rsquo;ing myself into a fantasy world where I had more friends than them, and those friends were more attractive and smarter and successful in every regard, as was I (who would often be the most so in every regard).</li>
<li>In high school, I had a crush on someone who had a crush on someone else, who I regarded as more successful than me. This made me intensely bitter, and I daydreamed that everything was reversed in the way you would hope.</li>
<li>In college, I became jealous upon finding out that someone else my age knew more about math, or went to a better college, or was taking harder courses, or lifted weights, or literally any frivolously nonsensical trigger. I daydreamed that everything was reversed.</li>
<li>In grad school (which is now), the other grad students (who I perceived as my competition) were all more friendly to each other than to me. Yet again, they were more than genial to me, and clearly curious about who I am as well, but I could not help but be intensely jealous and MD myself into a world very similar to point (1) above. Sometimes, I would even just daydream that I was closer friends with them, and that I was the most popular and attractive and successful person in the group (and the world lol).
Do you see the pattern? The daydream always arises <em>in response</em> to some insecurity in real life. And it is always the same insecurity, one about how I am lacking in comparison to other people and how those other people might be perceiving me. Note that every single maladaptive daydream is not actually caused by anything in the real world, or the environment which surrounds me. There is not even a shred of empathy or curiosity exhibited for the other real people involved. Instead, it is an exercise of narcissism, and the most obnoxious and boring kind of narcissism, centered on how I am more successful than others.</li>
</ol>
<p>I hate the mainstream portrayals and impressions of maladaptive daydreaming, such as the movie &ldquo;Secret Life of Walter Mitty&rdquo; or <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2018/04/05/598365217/invisibilia-when-daydreaming-gets-in-the-way-of-real-life">this</a> episode of the Invisibilia podcast. Maybe these depictions are applicable to the majority of maladaptive daydreamers, but they do nothing to describe my case. For me, the fantasy element or the superficial similarities to fanfiction or creative art are of zero importance. Even the aforementioned Invisibilia episode acknowledges the pitfalls of spending too much time in dreamland, but I remember being pissed off by the way the subject&rsquo;s daydreams are depicted as whimsical and almost cute, involving going to other planets and quirky fictional characters (even though, yes, that&rsquo;s a real person and their daydreams).</p>
<p>Nah, fuck that noise to the max.</p>
<p>I disagree with this impression (which I honestly believe that a lot of people who first hear about maladaptive daydreaming come to develop) that maladaptive daydreaming is a hallmark of a creative and quirky mind, or just means your creative brain juices are flowing, or can be a useful outlet for generating out-there ideas.</p>
<p>For me, daydreaming is pure and wasteful self-absorption. There is not a single activity in my life that is anywhere close to being more narcissistic than daydreaming. The contents of the daydreams are always derivative, uninteresting, and completely predictable. As stories, they possess zero literary value and in fact would have a negative effect to anyone who naively consumed them, as they risk the reader associating with the success depicted in the story.</p>
<p>Over time, it has made me extremely self-conscious, to the point where I will schizophrenically read even the most innocuous occurences as slights against my ego. It has made me preoccupied with success, in all the most vapid ways I define it, and with myself.</p>
<p>But, for the first time in my life, I am trying to stop.</p>
<p>I will write more about success and daydreaming in the future.</p>
