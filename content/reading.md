### broad reading interests
I am generally interested in fiction or non-fiction about:
* religion (especially orthodox Christianity, Buddhism, and Taoism)
* simple living and stoicism/asceticism and bohemianism and experimental lifestyle.
* philosophy, transcendantalism, astrology, the occult, magic, surrealism.
* culture war and politics and history and Asian-American culture.

...but I am open minded about what I read as there are lots of books above that fall outside of my interests or that I "disagree" with.
