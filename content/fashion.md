## broad themes
* emphasis on casual/comfy.
* somewhat averse to dressing overtly like typical academic/nerd or techbro.
* not preppy or formal.
* a little edge is welcome.
* mostly neutral and darker colors.
* somewhat of a preference for monochrome outfits.
* a lot of black color.
* in past, tended more towards minimalism, normcore but this is not fixed.
* slim fit or baggy can both be good.

## broad styles which appeal to me
* Korean men casual normcore/streetwear-lite (i.e., what is trendy there nowadays).
* athleisure/sportswear
* [techwear](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&sca_esv=577622371&q=casual+tech+wear&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjW69GIx5uCAxXYD1kFHdO2AjUQ0pQJegQIDRAB&biw=1440&bih=781&dpr=2)
